This project is a portable and local IoT Breathalyzer that can determine someoneâ€™s blood alcohol concentration and help them make safer decisions. The device used an MQ 3 alcohol sensors and return results that can be shared over the web and devices. For interpreting the results, the device contains an LCD screen to make the results easily viewable, and RGB led is present to indicate if the result is high and potentially unsafe so they can be understood if the user is visually impaired at the time. The results were also sent to a html website that could display them in greater detail, as well as used IFTTT to log a list of past results in a google sheet.
